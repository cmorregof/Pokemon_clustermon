# Pokemon_clustermon
This project implements a complete data science pipeline using a Pokémon dataset. It includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, clustering with K-Means and PCA, and a supervised regression model to predict offensive power. Results are documented and published on GitHub.

## Objective
Analyze Pokémon statistics to identify patterns and predict offensive power.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle — Pokémon Dataset (800 Pokémon)

## Methods
- EDA
- Missing value imputation
- KMeans clustering + PCA
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest

## Results
- Identified clusters of similar Pokémon
- Built a regression model to predict Attack (it did not work)

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
